From Visitor to Visionary

A UAE Success Story Powered by 44 Digital Business Services


He came to the UAE not as a tourist,
but as a dreamer.
A man with vision — and a visit visa issued by us.

He had no office.
No connections.
Only ambition in his eyes… and trust in our hands.

From day one, we stood beside him.
Together, we built his future — brick by brick, step by step.

We helped him establish his very first company — exactly as he imagined it.
✔️ Trade name
✔️ Initial approval
✔️ MOA drafting
✔️ Tenancy contract
✔️ Government submissions
✔️ Payment voucher settlement

Everything — flawlessly handled.

Next came the establishment card, the labour file, his personal code, and e-signature.
And when it was time to secure his stay —
We processed his Investor Visa, medical, Emirates ID, and stamping.
No queues. No confusion. Just clarity.

His business began to flourish.

We opened his corporate bank account.
Enabled online payment gateways.
Activated Tabby & Tamara.
Installed POS systems.
Registered for VAT and customs.
Designed his website.
And even trademarked his brand.

He was no longer a newcomer —
He was a name in the market.

Then, others saw his growth.
They wanted to join him — as partners, as team members.
We amended licenses, added his company as a shareholder, and managed it all legally and efficiently.

As he expanded, his team grew.
And so did our support.

We helped him hire —
Getting labour quotas, offer letters, insurance, contracts, permits, and both skilled and unskilled visas.
We handled every medical test, every Emirates ID, and even doorstep delivery.

He expanded across Emirates.
Opened branches.
Launched kiosks in major malls.
And we stayed by his side —
Issuing permits, handling legalities, processing government documents, and ensuring every detail was perfect.

Then came a milestone.

He invested in real estate — a property worth over AED 2 million.
And we applied for his Golden Visa.
Just 7 working days later,
He held a 10-year Golden Visa — in his name.

And he didn’t stop there.
His wife, his children, his parents — all received Golden Visas.
We arranged premium health insurance for each of them.

But his greatest success?
He brought his people forward, too.

His top staff earning AED 30,000+?
We secured Golden Visas for them as well — and for their families.
We helped them with certificate equivalency from the Ministry of Education, ensuring they met every eligibility criteria.

And for the rest?
We arranged 2-year visas.
Helped them sponsor their families.
Parents, siblings — we arranged visit and dependent visas with ease.

One by one, they all began to grow.
Inspired by him.
Supported by us.

Many of them went on to start their own companies —
Across different activities.
In mainland and free zones.
From fashion to food, tech to trading —
We set them all up with confidence.

Today…
They are more than a business.

They are a community.
A family of entrepreneurs.
A network of visionaries.
And the heart behind it all —
Is the belief that no dream is too big, and no detail too small.

We are 44 Digital Business Services.
We don’t just process transactions.
We build legacies.
We turn visitors into visionaries.

And your story could be next.
